            Fullmetal Alchemist (Japanese: 鋼の錬金術師, Hepburn: Hagane no Renkinjutsushi, lit. "Alchemist of
            Steel") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa. It was serialized in
            Square Enix's shōnen manga anthology magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan between July 2001 and June 2010; the
            publisher later collected the individual chapters in 27 tankōbon volumes. The steampunk world of
            Fullmetal Alchemist is primarily styled after the European Industrial Revolution. Set in the early 20th
            century, in a fictional universe in which alchemy is a widely practiced science, the series follows the
            journey of two alchemist brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who are searching for the philosopher's
            stone to restore their bodies after a failed attempt to bring their mother back to life using alchemy.

                The manga has sold over 80 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It received the 49th Shogakukan Manga Award for the shōnen category in 2004, the UK's Eagle Award for favorite manga in 2010 and 2011, and the Seiun Award for best science fiction comic in 2011. Reviewers from several media outlets positively critiqued the series, particularly for its character development, action scenes, symbolism, and philosophical references.
