                Literary and shocking works always seem to have similar beginnings. The anime masterpiece "Attack on
                Titan" with a Douban score of 9.9 is a magical realism work. Its appearance tells people that animation
                works can also have profound literary qualities, and such literary qualities are open to the public.
                Power and weakness are always opposites, and giants and humans are also natural opposites in the play.
                In order to avoid the powerful giants, the weak humans found an isolated island called Parady, built
                three walls, and lived in the walls for 100 years. During these 100 years, only a group of lunatics
                called the Survey Corps were exploring outside the wall. Why can't this kind of peace last forever?
                Because "no man is an island." (Hemingway, "For Whom the Bell Tolls"), walls can stop the evil of
                giants, but they cannot stop the inherent evil of human nature. Amin, a wise young man, whose parents
                longed for freedom, sacrificed themselves during the investigation outside the wall. Dependent on his
                grandfather, he was bullied. Fortunately, he was helped by a neighbor boy named Allen. Mikasa, the "Last
                Descendant of the Orient", had her parents murdered by human traffickers because of her mother's and her
                own Oriental ancestry. He was later adopted by the Allen family. Allen, a hot-blooded young man, whose
                mother was devoured on the day the giant broke the wall, started a battle with Amin and Mikasa to
                eliminate the giant.

                However, later, they discovered that the giants were also transformed from humans and were descendants
                of the ancestor Ymir from outside the island. The essence of giant cannibalism is that humans
                cannibalize humans. Over the past 100 years, the truth recorded in history books has only been written
                in three words: "People eat people." The opportunity to discover this truth was the infiltration of
                three young spies from outside the island. In order to achieve their goals, these three giant teenagers
                from outside the island planned to break down the wall, shattering the 100-year peace on the island. In
                the chaos, he joined the training soldiers together with the orphaned Allen and others. It turns out
                that the betrayer is the partner who once shared life and death. Extreme symmetry, fierce
                contradictions, and a twisted world.

                The world view perspective is switched to the three betrayers. Rebelio Containment Area, a place similar
                to a concentration camp, is where the people from the original ancestor Ymir Island gathered. They live
                under the repressive rule of the Malai State and work tirelessly to become honorary Malai people. And
                Marais was once enslaved by Ymir, like a cursed reincarnation. Perhaps the greatest historical lesson
                for mankind is to never learn the lessons of history. Bertolt, in order to get better medical treatment
                for his sick father, worked hard to become one of the giants who sneaked into the wall. Later, he died
                gloriously. Mr. Bertot was treated kindly throughout his life and has always been proud of his son. Ani
                was adopted by his adoptive father since he was a child and was trained inhumanely just to satisfy his
                adoptive father's desire to become an honorary Malay man. But the day before she truly became a giant,
                her adoptive father held her in his arms and cried, "Arnie, remember, even if you become the enemy of
                the previous world in the future, your father will always be on your side, and you must come back
                alive." Reiner, who had long been indoctrinated by his mother to think that people outside the island
                were devils, made it his mission to exterminate the people on the island for the sake of the freedom of
                the people in the Rebellious District. He truly dedicated himself to the people outside the island and
                died. In the end, they are just war machines used by politicians. Those who pursue freedom will
                eventually be bound by freedom, and those who pursue happiness will eventually be burdened by happiness.
                Great works often try to solve the most eternal topics of mankind, such as freedom and human nature.
